## Visão Geral

### O desafio

O usuário deveria ser capaz de:

- Se conectar ao aplicativo usando a sua conta do Github, com Oauth
- Consumir uma API e estilizar
- Enviar uma mensagem
- Ver comentários ao vivo no App

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

background-image: linear-gradient(315deg, #7ee8fa 0%, #80ff72 74%);

### Oque eu aprendi

Bom primeiro de tudo eu aprendi sobre o `Vite` e eu vi que realmente, ele é bem mais performático!
Ele cria o seu app bem mais rápido, para inicializar a aplicação `yarn dev` é bem mais rápido também.
Nada do que eu usei se compara com ele, eu com certeza vou usar nas minhas próximas aplicações.

```tsx
```

```tsx
```

```tsx
```
